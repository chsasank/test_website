## Advantages of Jira Core

* **Rroadmap requirements.** Jira has tools that enable users to sketch out the big picture, communicate plans, and connect the bigger roadmap goals to the teamâ€™s everyday tasks.

Also, users can organize tickets into sprints and releases, and also monitor the workload and task assignments of the team.
* **Available integration.** The issue and project tracking software integrate with many popular third-party software. For example, integration with Hipchat and Slack makes it easy to communicate issues and respond to notifications. More than 3000 apps are available at the Atlassian Marketplace to extend the features of the software.

* **Works for different types of users.** The software can be used by developers, project managers, engineers, managers, and other non-tech business professionals.


## Disadvantages of Jira Core:

* **Not the best mobile app**. Jira users are more than satisfied with its web version, but not so much with its mobile app. They complain of having to navigate a lot in order to do various tasks. In contrast, they can all do these actions smoothly in the web version.
* **Complex integration and migration** from other application lifecycle management (ALM) systems. Migrating a project, for example, from Microsoft Team Foundation Server into Jira involves manually migrating each artifact into Jira, which is very time-consuming.
* **Reports are not reusable**. Jira graphical reports cannot be downloaded as an image. Using other methods alters the resolution of the images, resulting in poor images.
* **Limited file size upload.** Users complain that the file size upload is limited to 10MB or less. Therefore, uploading a photo, video, or document that is more than 10MB in size is not allowed.
* **Confusing UI.** Some people find the user interface a bit cluttered, and filtering tools are not the easiest to use. Also, some find the configurations confusing, because some parts of the software still use an older version of their graphical interface, while some parts are newer.
