# What is the No.1 killer of women? If you think it is breast cancer, you are totally wrong!

## The No.1 killer of women is HEART DISEASE!! 


Are you surprised? Did you think heart disease was a disease of men? Did you think the female hormones can protect against heart diseases? Absolutely not!!

1 in 5 death in women is due to heart disease and this number is true for all women who are more than 20 years of age. 

If you have one of these, you are likely to develop heart disease.

So, what can cause heart disease? The silent contributors are high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking. If you are on the east side of the world, add diabetes to this list. If these four are not well controlled, you are going to get your No.1 killer one day or another.

You are wrong if you thought there will be the classical chest pain that men develop when you have heart disease.

The well-known squeezing chest pain is the common symptom of a heart disease. But women have symptoms that are very different than what men have. There may not be chest pain, there may not be left shoulder pain but SHOCKINGLY there will be just nausea, vomiting and tiredness. Ainâ€™t these symptoms felt everyday by a woman? Should we run to the emergency room every time we have these symptoms? NO!! The best way is to prevent it. Prevent before it comes, so you can live and radiate!

First, treat and control the medical conditions you already have, WELL! Second, nourish your body with a diet rich in proteins and nutrition and avoid at least deep-fried foods. Third, exercise as much as your body can let you; focus on the strength of your muscles and higher heart rate. Finally, the most under rated risk factor, STRESS; you have got to find ways to manage your stress. 

There you have it! Let me know your questions and I am happy to help.
